# SE_Lab_project1
# Smart Building IoT Platform
## Branching Strategy
- **main branch**: Stable and protected.
- **Feature branches**: All new features are developed in separate branches (e.g., `feature/iot-sensors`, `feature/web-dashboard`).
- **Merging Policy**: Changes are only merged into `main` through pull requests after passing CI tests and code reviews.
## Feature Branches
- `feature/iot-sensors`: This branch is responsible for the development of IoT sensor scripts and data collection mechanisms.
- `feature/web-dashboard`: This branch is for building the web-based dashboard to display sensor data.
